# Java Developer Recruitment Test
Thanks for your interest in a developer role at Computershare, and taking the time to do our technical challenge. It consists of two parts:

- **A coding challenge**
- **A few technical questions**

Once completed, please submit your solution as a zip or github link to someaddress@computershare.co.uk.

### Challenge (option 1)
- Using a publicly available API (Yahoo Finance API, Finnhub Stock API) retrieve a weeks worth of historical share price data for a user supplied company (e.g. BPP, VOD). Alternatively you can use your own mocked out repository, 
- Display the stock name and minimum, maximum and average share price over the week.
- Allow the user to export this as a JSON file.

#### User Story 
As a **user running the system**

I can **view basic stock information on a company**

So that **I can make a decision on what stock to buy**

As a **user running the system**

I can **export basic stock information on a company in JSON format**

So that **I can import it to other systems**

### Challenge (option 2)
Creating an "interesting" Java console application with a financial theme. It should be imaginative, give a flavour of your development process, and take into account the constraints below.

### Contraints

- Feel free to spend as much or as little time on the exercise as you like as long as the user story above has been met.
- Your code should compile and run in one step.
- Feel free to use whatever frameworks / libraries / packages you like.
- All stories to be completed with an appropriate level of testing.
- Please avoid including artefacts from your local build (such as NuGet packages or the bin folder(s)) in your final ZIP file
- The solution must be your own work. Any third-party code, libraries or services used should be clearly identified.

### Technical Questions

Please answer the following questions in a markdown file called *Answers to technical questions.md*. We will discuss them further if you come in for a face to face interview.

- How long did you spend on the coding challenge?
- What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
- What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
- How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
- Please describe yourself using JSON.

Thanks for your time, we look forward to hearing from you!
